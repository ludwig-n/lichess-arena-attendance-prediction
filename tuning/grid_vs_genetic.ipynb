    "Despite the score difference, the best hyperparameter combinations found by both algorithms are fairly similar. It appears that the genetic algorithm was able to find a better combination of hyperparameters because it had more freedom to select hyperparameter values from within the available range. For example, for the `max_features` hyperparameter the grid search had only 4 possible options: 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1. (Of course, the number of options could be increased, but this would significantly hurt performance: in this case adding another possible value of `max_features` would slow down the algorithm by 25\\%.) The genetic algorithm was able to find the more optimal value of ~0.91, since during mutations new values of `max_features` are sampled uniformly from the [0.25, 1] range. However, this does depend on luck, and it's possible that in another experiment the genetic algorithm would never generate that mutation and end up with a worse result instead. The grid search at least guarantees that every combination of hyperparameter values in the grid will be tested, even if those values aren't optimal."

    "The genetic algorithm seems to be slightly faster, even though the number of trained models is about the same. One reason for this could be that the grid search is forced to evaluate every single parameter combination, including those which are slow to train. If these slow combinations also happen to produce worse model quality (e.g. learning rate too small), then they will quickly \"go extinct\" in the generic algorithm and it won't spend as much time evaluating them.\n",

    "It should be noted that the genetic algorithm could be made even faster with caching. Since there are usually many identical individuals (hyperparameter combinations) in the population, the genetic algorithm often has to train and evaluate the model with the exact same hyperparameters several times. If the scores for these models were cached, the algorithm would be much more efficient. The `gentun` library does not seem to implement this natively, but it could be implemented in a custom `Handler` subclass."

However, this could change on a different task where the slower models actually have higher quality. In addition, the genetic algorithm can be made even faster with caching, unlike grid search.\n",
